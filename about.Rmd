When I’m reading a paper I have the (bad) habit of spending way too much time trying to reproduce the results and tweak the analysis. This is both to check that I understood what the authors did and also to check if the results are robust.

So I decided that instead of rotting in my hard-drive, I’ll publish these quick-and-dirty analysis here for others to see and, hopefully, benefit from. If you find something here that you like, feel free to give me a shout-out on twitter and/or a citation or two on a published paper.

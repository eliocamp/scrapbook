# title: Sea Ice Area climatologies and 21st century change in the CMIP5 and CMIP6 multi-model ensembles
# summary: This dataset comprises summary statistics regarding historical and projected Southern Hemisphere total sea ice area (SIA) and 21st century global temperature change (dTAS), evaluated from the multi-model ensembles contributing to CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 5 and 6). The metrics are evaluated for two climatological periods (1979-2014 and 2081-2100) from a number of CMIP experiments; historical, and ScenarioMIP or RCP runs. These metrics were calculated to calculate projections of future Antarctic sea ice loss, and drivers of ensemble spread in this variable, for Holmes et al. (2022) "Antarctic sea ice projections constrained by historical ice cover and future global temperature change"

# comment: For each combination of forcing scenario, dataset (i.e. CMIP5 or CMIP6 or special subsets therein) and season (February or September) and for each pair of variables named 'xname' and 'yname', the datafile contains full regression statistics:
# : * ensemble minimum, mean and max (as in Holmes et al. (2022) Table 1) and standard deviation of each variable
# : * r2 and its p-value, regression slope and intercept
# : * Where relevant, the constrained prediction, ; this constitutes the central prediction, 95% confidence interval, and 95% prediction interval. These correspond to the values in Holmes et al (2022) Figure 1b and 1d.
# : * There are 71 data rows: these correspond to 60 standard cases ((2 seasons)*(3 forcing scenarios)*(2 generations, CMIP5 and CMIP6) for 5 variable pairs (SIAhist:dSIA, SIAhist:dTAS, dTAS:dSIA, ECS:dSIA, and the multiple regressions)) plus eleven special cases for subsets of all models.
# : * All SIA (Sea Ice Area) values have units Mkm2 and temperatures have units deg C.

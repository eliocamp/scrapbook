abstract = {Abstract Simple models of wave-mean flow interaction in the Northern Hemisphere winter stratosphere suggest the existence of subseasonal vacillations in the strength of the polar vortex. Here, we define a sinusoidal fit to the daily deseasonalized stratospheric wind. A suitable fixed period and amplitude for the sine waves is identified. Their mean value, equivalent to polar vortex strength, and phase, equivalent to the timing of sudden stratospheric warmings during winter, varies from year to year. These vacillations explain much of the subseasonal and interannual variability in the monthly mean vortex strength and, consistent with wave-mean flow interaction theory, their amplitude correlates positively with the magnitude of winter mean planetary wave driving. Furthermore, they allow skillful prediction of the vortex strength one month ahead. Identifying and understanding this subseasonal variability has potential implications for winter seasonal forecasts, as the December–February mean behavior may miss important subseasonal events.},

abstract = {This article describes the UK Met Office Global Seasonal forecast system version 5 (GloSea5). GloSea5 upgrades include an increase in horizontal resolution in the atmosphere (N216–0.7°) and the ocean (0.25°), and implementation of a 3D-Var assimilation system for ocean and sea-ice conditions. GloSea5 shows improved year-to-year predictions of the major modes of variability. In the Tropics, predictions of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation are improved with reduced errors in the West Pacific. In the Extratropics, GloSea5 shows unprecedented levels of forecast skill and reliability for both the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation. We also find useful levels of skill for the western North Pacific Subtropical High which largely determines summer precipitation over East Asia.},

  abstract = {Exploratory analysis using empirical orthogonal function revealed the presence of a stationary zonal wavenumber-4 (W4) pattern in the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in the southern subtropics (20\textdegree S\textendash 55\textdegree S). The signal over the Southern subtropics is seasonally phase-locked to the austral summer and persists up to mid-autumn. Thermodynamic coupling of atmosphere and the upper ocean helps in generating the W4 pattern, which later terminates due to the breaking of that coupled feedback. It is found that the presence of anomalous SST due to W4 mode in the surrounding of Australia affects the rainfall over the continent by modulating the local atmospheric circulation. During positive phase of W4 event, the presence of cold SST anomaly over the south-eastern and -western side of Australia creates an anomalous divergence circulation. This favours the moisture transport towards south-eastern Australia, resulting in more rainfall in February. The scenario reverses in case of a negative W4 event. There is also a difference of one month between the occurrence of positive and negative W4 peaks. This asymmetry seems to be responsible for the weak SST signal to the South of Australia. Correlation analysis suggests that the W4 pattern in SST is independent of other natural variabilities such as Southern Annular Mode, and Indian Ocean Dipole as well as a rather weak relationship with El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Zonal Wave 3 (ZW3) is an important feature of the Southern Hemisphere extratropical atmospheric circulation and has strong impacts on meridional heat and momentum transport, regional Antarctic sea-ice extent as well as Southern Hemisphere blocking events. Attempts have been made in the past to define an index that quantifies the variability in the ZW3 pattern; however, existing methods are based on fixed geographical locations and fail to capture certain ZW3 events because of strong variability in phase. In addition, a fixed spatial index poorly characterizes ZW3 in CMIP models, which can exhibit biases in the mean phase of the ZW3 pattern. In this study, we introduce a new way to characterize ZW3 variability by incorporating two indices, one each for magnitude and phase, based on the combination of the first two Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) of the 500 hPa meridional wind anomalies. We show that the new ZW3 index provides a clear advantage over past indices because it captures a substantially higher proportion of variance (\textasciitilde 40\% compared to \textasciitilde 16\%), and it can be used for both reanalysis data sets and coupled climate models regardless of model biases. A composite analysis associated with the new index reveals a strong relationship between the ZW3 defined by our index and sea-ice fraction around Antarctica, with significant regional sea-ice anomalies during strong ZW3 events with different phases.},

Combinations of simple progressive and standing oscillations are used to examine the properties of this technique. These examples illustrate that although CPC analysis allows for the identification of traveling waves, many of the drawbacks associated with conventional principal component analysis remain, and sometimes become worse; e.g. the interpretation of CPC solutions is more difficult since both amplitude and phase relationships must be considered. A method for linearly transforming complex principal components was devised in order to identify regional relationships within large geophysical data sets. The errors in CPC analysis resulting from limited sample sizes are discussed.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {In this study 500 hPa geopotential heights from the NCAR-NCEP Reanalysis are used to calculate an index describing the spatial and temporal characteristics of zonal wave three (ZW3) in the high latitude Southern Hemisphere atmosphere. The index spans the period 1958â€“2001. Wavelet analysis of the index shows the strong interannual variation which is characteristic of ZW3 and also reveals significant, high amplitude decadal-scale variation. This interannual variation takes the form of marked fluctuation in sign and magnitude of the index. It appears to occur when there are rapid changes from strongly meridional to strongly zonal flow or vice versa. Initial indications are that some of this variability may be associated with ENSO events.},
